# Python-Scripting-Playgorund-Files

These files are to practise some of the skills you need with python scripting like encoding, decoding, web requests , web scraping and hashing

installation : `sudo git clone https://github.com/khaled1000emad/Python-Scripting-Playgorund-Files.git`

You can deploy these files either manually by moving them to `/var/www/html` and start working or by using docker :
 - Go to the directory where the repo is installed
 - type the following command : `docker-compose up` 
 - After it finishes go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` and enjoy messing around with your python skills

If you don't have docker you can install it :
 - `sudo apt update`
 - ``sudo apt install docker && sudo apt install docker-compose`
